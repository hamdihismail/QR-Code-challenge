## My process

After setting up githup repository and sass, I started with the HTML markup. Next, I setup my style variables in SASS using the style-guide provided. After setting up my variables I went on to style in SASS. Once the styling was complete to satisfaction, I created the media query break points for the mobile screen and adjusted the sizing of the design to fit nicely on a smaller screen. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge really helped reinforce and practice what I have learned of HTML, CSS, and SASS. I gained a better understanding of using github.

### Continued development

As a beginner I really need to continue tackling more challenges that get progressively more difficult and including some JavaScript.
